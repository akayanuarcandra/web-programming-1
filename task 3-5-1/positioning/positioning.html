<p id="s1"><img src="images/crown.gif" alt="">Objects in the normal flow affect the layout of the objects around them. This
is the behavior you’ve come to expect in web pages—elements don’t overlap or bunch up. They make room for one another.
We’ve seen all of this before, but in this chapter we’ll be paying attention to whether elements are in the flow or removed from the flow. Floating and
positioning change the relationship of elements to the normal flow in different ways. Let’s first look at the special behavior of floated elements (or
“floats” for short).Simply stated, the float property moves an element as far as possible to the left or right, allowing the following content to wrap around it. It is not
a positioning scheme per se, but a unique feature built into CSS with some interesting behaviors. Floats are one of the primary tools of modern CSSbased
web design, used to create multicolumn layouts, navigation toolbars from lists, and table-like alignment without tables. Let’s start with the float
property itself.I will certainly point out when a property is known to cause fussybrowser behavior. By the time you are
reading this, the offending browsers may already be off the radar. The best way to explain floating is to demonstrate it. In this example, the
float property is applied to an img element to float it to the right. The best advice I can give you is to test your
designs on as many browsers and devices as you can get your hands on and fix things that appear to be broken. Web searches for particular
properties or browsers plus “bugs” usually turn up posts by developers having similar problems or offering potential workarounds. You can also

<p id="s2"> Let’s look at what happens when you float a block within the normal flow.</p>
<p id="s3"> <span class="notice">Notice:Always provide a width for floated text elements.Floated inline elements behave as block elements.</span> 
Those are the basics…let’s look at more examples and explore additional floating behaviors. Before style sheets, the only thing you could float was an
image by using the obsolete align attribute. With CSS, it is possible to float any HTML element, both inline and block-level, as we’ll see in the following
examples.Floating inline and block elements First, you’ll notice that the style rule that floats the span includes the width property. In fact, it is necessary to specify a width for floated text
elements because without one, the content area of the box expands to its widest possible width (or, on some browsers, it may collapse to its
narrowest possible width). <em>Images have an inherent width, so we didn’t need to specify a width in the previous example </em>(although we certainly
could have).Notice that the margin is held on all four sides of the floated span text,even though top and bottom margins are usually not rendered on inline
elements (see Figure 14-18 in the previous chapter). That is because all floated elements behave like block elements. Once you float an inline
element, it follows the display rules for block-level elements, and margins are rendered on all four sides.</P>
