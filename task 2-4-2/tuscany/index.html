<h1>Adventures in Tuscany</h1>
<p>This is a short chronicle of my visit to Italy. Click on the thumbnails to see a larger view of each photograph. Enjoy!</p>

<h2>Pozzarello</h2>
<p><a href="window.html"><img src="thumbnails/window_thumb.jpg" alt="view from the bedroom window" width="75" height="100"></a> The house we stayed in was called Pozzarello and it was built around the year 1200 as the home of the gardner who tended the grounds of the adjacent castle. The thick walls kept us nice and cool inside, despite the blistering mid-day heat. This is the view from our bedroom window.</p>

<h2>The Tuscan Countryside</h2>
<p><a href="photo%20pages/countryside.html"><img src="thumbnails/countryside_thumb.jpg" alt="view from the tuscan countryside" width="75" height="100"></a>This is the scene on the way to Montalcino (all roads lead to Montalcino!). It looks a lot like the scene on the way to Sienna, and the scene on the way to the grocery store. We were surrounded by beautiful countryside for most of our travels.</p>

<h2>Sienna</h2>
<p><a href="photo%20pages/sienna.html"><img src="thumbnails/sienna_thumb.jpg" alt="view from sienna" width="75" height="100"></a>The closest city to our villa was Sienna, about 30 minutes away. We spent many days exploring the steep and crooked streets, sampling the local cuisine at outdoor restaurants, and stopping in the dark and echoey Duomo to escape the sun.</p>

<h2>The Sweets</h2>
<p><a href="photo%20pages/sweets.html"><img src="thumbnails/sweets_thumb.jpg" alt="the sweets"></a>The sweets of Sienna, an historic and much-loved destination thatâ€™s widely known for the sumptuous sweets that add to the charm and lure of Tuscany.</p>

<h2>The Cathedral</h2>
<p><a href="photo%20pages/cathedral.html"><img src="thumbnails/cathedral_thumb.jpg" alt="view of the cathedral" width="75" height="100"></a>The cathedral in Sienna is a marvel of architecture and art. The floors are covered in intricate mosaics, and the walls are painted with scenes from the Bible. The cathedral is a must-see for anyone visiting the area.</p>

<h2>The Lavender</h2>
<p><a href="photo%20pages/lavender.html"><img src="thumbnails/lavender_thumb.jpg" alt="the lavender"></a>The lavender in Sienna is simply a beautiful flower that happens to able to find in across Sienna. It's one of the prettiest flower that you can simply find it in Sienna.</p>
