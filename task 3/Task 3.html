    <h1>Low and Slow</h1>
    <p>posted by BGB, November 15, 2016</p>
    <p>
        This week I am extremely excited about a new cooking technique called sous vide. In sous vide cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want it cooked to. In his book, Cooking for Geeks, Jeff Potter describes it as "ultra-low-temperature poaching."

        Next month, we will be serving <b><i>Sous Vide</i> Salmon with Dill Hollandaise</b>. To reserve a seat at the chef's table, contact us before November 30.
