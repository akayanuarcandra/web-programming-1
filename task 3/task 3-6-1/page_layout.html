      <p>Now that you understand the principles of moving elements around on the page using CSS floats and positioning, we can put these tools to use in some
         standard page layouts. This chapter looks at the various approaches to CSSdriven web design and provides some simple templates that will get you on
         your way to building basic two- and three-column web pages.</P>
      <p>Before we get started, it must be said that there are seemingly endless variations on creating multicolumn layouts with CSS. This chapter is intended
         to be a “starter kit.” The templates presented here are simplified and may not work for every situation, although I’ve tried to point out the relevant
         shortcomings of each.</p>
      <p>Before we start dissecting CSS layouts, let’s talk about the various options for structuring a web page. As you know, web pages appear on browsers of
         all sizes, from tiny phone screens to cinema displays. In addition, users can resize their text, which has an impact on the layout of the page. Over time,
         several standard page layout approaches have emerged that address these issues in various ways:</P>
      <p>When you design a page to be a specific width, you need to decide a couple of things. First, you need to pick the width, usually based on common monitor
         resolutions. As of this writing, most sites are designed to be 960 pixels wide or thereabouts to fit nicely in the most common 1024 × 768 monitor
         resolution. Some designers keep their layouts narrower; some venture even larger as monitor resolution increases. Either way, it is a design decision.</P>
      <p>You also need to decide where the fixed-width layout should be positioned
         in the browser window. By default, it stays on the left edge of the browser,
         with the extra space to the right of it. You can also center the page, splitting
         the extra space over left and right margins, which may make the page look
         as though it better fills the browser window. Figure 16-1 shows two fixedwidth
         layouts, positioned differently in the browser window.</P>
      <p>Fixed layouts stay put at a specific pixel width regardless of the size of the browser window or text size.</P>
      <p>Fluid (or liquid) layouts resize proportionally when the browser windowresizes.</P>
      <p>Elastic layouts resize proportionally based on the size of the text.</P>
      <p>Hybrid layouts combine fixed and scalable areas.</P>
   </div>
   <div id="extras">
      <h1>extras column</h1>
      <p>Fixed layouts, as the name implies, are created at a specific pixel width as determined by the designer. Akin to print, they allow the designer to control
         the relationship of page elements, alignment, and line lengths (see the sidebar Optimal Line Length).</P>
      <p>This layout approach became popular due to the fact that folks have traditionally viewed the Web primarily on desktop
         monitors with ample real estate, and web designers were keen on reproducing designs that looked exactly the same on every screen.</P>
      <p>But as you know, times are a’changin’, and we no longer make those assumptions or strive for pixel perfection.</P>
